> CS12 PROGRAM ASSESSMENT
This project was an assessment for my year-12 computer science course, This program is a feature-pentiful burrito ordering TUI that lets you add orders, edit orders and delete orders. Through a series of prompts the user can add a new order and with a few simple keypresses they can remove an order. This project was made with no prior planning (my most popular development principle) and it was done under a deadline. Take of that what you will.
